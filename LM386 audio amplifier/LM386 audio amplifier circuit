The integrated chip LM386 is a low power audio frequency 
amplifier requiring a low level power supply (most often batteries). It comes in an 8-pin mini-DIP package. 
The IC is designed to deliver a voltage amplification of 20 without external add-on parts.
But this voltage gain can be raised up to 200 (Vu = 200) by adding external parts.
