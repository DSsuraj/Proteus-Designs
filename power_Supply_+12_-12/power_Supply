The problem here is that the voltage will change significantly when the battery is charged.
There is no straight-forward way to determine the "idle" voltage of the battery while it is charging.
Thus, implementing this requires some heuristic to approach the desired voltage as precisely as possible.
Furthermore, the user must also provide a "recharge threshold voltage", which will certainly overstrain non-expert users.
