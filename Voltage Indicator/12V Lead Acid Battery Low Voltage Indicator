This is a simple circuit that will indicate a low voltage on a 12V lead acid battery.
Many that have golf carts, small EV’s, RV’s, or solar power banks for homes have a number of 12V lead acid batteries
to maintain and this circuit will help protect your investment while not using these batteries. When stored, batteries 
will self discharge, and if left for too long, will self-discharge to a damaging level. This circuit will light an LED when 
the battery voltage decreases to 11.6V. 
When the LED turns on, you’ know it is time to charge the battery to prevent the battery from dying on the shelf.
